I am a graduate student in Complex Systems and Data Science at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](vermontcomplexsystems.org). My research involves network science, Bayesian statistics, complex systems, and decision theory. I'm interested in the application of these tools to improve decision-making in complex social systems.
