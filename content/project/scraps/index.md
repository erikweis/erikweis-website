SCRAPS stands for **S**tudent **C**omplexity **R**esearch **a**nd **P**izza **S**eminar. It's a graduate seminar I organize every week, and it's exactly like it sounds. We order pizza and someone talks about their research in some facet of complex systems. A lot of the work that's presented is early-stage or ongoing work, so we never expect polished presentations. 

Instead, it's a great opportunity for presenters to step out of the weeds of their work and get feedback, all while builing communication skills.
For attendees, SCRAPS is a great way to learn about the huge variety of work going on in the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org). Free pizza is also a nice carrot!
On a meta level, SCRAPS provides one of many venues for interdisciplinary collaboration that goes in the center!
Complex systems (at least at our center) encompasses a huge range of fields, from the study of infectious diseases, computational finance, fundamental machine learning, evolutionary robotics, network science, informatics, and computational social science.
This rich diversity is perfect for the cross-polination of ideas, but requires that participants share a common language.
SCRAPS is just one of the many ways VCSC foster's those collaborations.
